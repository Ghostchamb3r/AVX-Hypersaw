# AVX-Hypersaw
An implementation of the HTWO (Hyperbolic Tangent Waveshaping oscillator) for Csound that uses AVX processing in the sine wave generation and tanh lookup tables with hermite interpolation.

The AVX hypersaw is implemented from the formula process described by V. Lazzarini in the following paper: Lazzarini, V. & Timoney, J. "New Perspectives on Distortion Synthesis for Virtual Analog Oscillators", Computer music journal, vol. 34, no. 1, 2010, pp. 28-40.
